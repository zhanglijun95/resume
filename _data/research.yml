- title: Application of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in Specific Problems
  leader: Advised by Prof. Lin Zhang
  duration: May, 2018 &mdash; Sept, 2018
  details:
    - detail: Researched on the application of GAN, including super-resolution (SR) and no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA).
    - detail: Introduced Wasserstein distance and gradient magnitude similarity deviation into the original loss function to promote the performance of SRGAN.
    - detail: Proposed to generate image quality feature map of a single input image by Pix2Pix-GAN trained on pairs of distorted images and their corresponding quality feature maps.

- title: Image Quality Assessment
  leader: Advised by Prof. Lin Zhang
  duration: Jan, 2016 &mdash; Dec, 2018
  details:
    - detail: Researched on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA). Mainly focused on face image illumination quality and image exposure quality.
    - detail: Established a database of face images with various illumination situations and propose a convolutional neural network method to evaluate face images illumination quality. A research paper has been published on ICONIP 2017 (CCF-C, indexed by EI).
    - detail: Proposed an algorithm towards automatic image exposure level assessment. A research paper has been published by ICME 2018 (CCF-B, indexed by EI).
