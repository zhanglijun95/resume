  description: (a)&sim;(f) are 6 images with various exposure levels. Their exposure scores predicted by our approach IEpsM are 1.0115, 2.0219, 2.9686, 4.1119, 5.2048, and 6.3953, respectively. The output range of IEpsM is from 1 to 7. “1” means the image is extremely underexposed, “4” means it is properly exposed, and “7” means it is extremely overexposed.
